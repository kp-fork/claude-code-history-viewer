# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot providers** — read-only browsing of GitHub Copilot CLI (`~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/events.jsonl`, tool calls paired via `toolCallId`, resume via `copilot --resume=<id>`), Copilot Desktop (same on-disk format, differentiated via `workspace.yaml::client_name`), and VS Code Copilot Chat (`workspaceStorage/.../chatSessions/*.jsonl` replayed as a `kind:0` snapshot + `kind:1`/`kind:2` patch log; detects Code/Insiders/VSCodium). All three participate in WSL scanning and global search. (#415, rebase of #350)
- **Headless session export** — new `--export <session-id|/abs/path.jsonl> [--format html|json] [--output <file>]` flag renders a report and exits without launching the GUI, for SSH/CI use. HTML output is a Rust port of the in-app exporter (markdown via `comrak`); session ids resolve under `~/.claude/projects` (unambiguous prefix accepted) and the file is written atomically. (#413)
- **Most Used Skills / Most Used Subagents analytics** — tool-usage stats now break Claude `Skill` and `Agent` calls out into dedicated sections keyed by `input.skill` / `input.subagent_type`, at both project and global scope; sections are hidden when empty so non-Claude providers are unaffected. (#414)
- **One-click Full Backup** — an Archive Manager "Full Backup" card copies every session from all Claude Code projects into per-project archives in a single action (with an "Include subagent transcripts" toggle), so history survives Claude Code's automatic cleanup. (#411)

### Fixed
- The font-size setting now applies to the whole app, not just the left panel: ~256 hardcoded `text-[Npx]` classes (and the `prose-xs` markdown variant) were made reactive to the setting, so the message viewer, analytics, session board, and settings dialogs scale together. Pixel-exact at the default scale. (#412)
- Session delete now falls back to a permanent delete when the system trash is unavailable (Windows Recycle Bin disabled, network drives, locked files) instead of surfacing an opaque failure; the delete-confirmation copy reflects this across all 5 locales. (#410)
- Codex session delete removes the orphaned `threads` row left in `state_5.sqlite` by a prior native rename — best-effort, never blocking the delete. (#409)

### New Contributors
- @theontho (#350 → #415)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Three new read-only providers**: **Cursor Agent** (`~/.cursor/projects/.../agent-transcripts`, distinct from the Cursor IDE source) (#304, #397), **Kimi CLI** (`~/.kimi` sessions, `kimi -r` resume) (#349), and **Kiro CLI** (SQLite-backed `kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`) (#324).
- **Codex native rename & delete**: rename writes `threads.title` in `state_5.sqlite` (the resume-picker-visible name) while the rollout transcript stays immutable; honors `CODEX_HOME` for both `sessions` and `archived_sessions`; a new in-app delete confirmation dialog replaces the OS-native prompt. (#373)

### Changed
- Codex project-list scans now mmap + memchr-scan only the `session_meta` line instead of fully parsing every rollout, and each provider scans independently so a slow provider no longer blocks fast ones from appearing. (#370)
- In-session search indexing moved to a Web Worker (FlexSearch) so indexing a large session no longer blocks the UI. (#352)
- Claude project name and the `claude --resume` working directory are now resolved from session JSONL metadata instead of the lossy storage-dir encoding. `CACHE_VERSION` bumped to 10 (one-time transparent re-scan on first launch). (#369)

### Fixed
- Removed blank gaps in the virtualized message history and stopped the first rows rendering under the sticky header, while preserving the subagent-crash (#334) and sidechain (#389) handling. (#371)
- Kimi watcher auto-refresh on macOS: canonicalize the event path before base-path matching (`/var` → `/private/var` symlink). (#407)
- Cursor scan no longer panics on multibyte/percent workspace-folder names. (#398)
- Claude native rename uses the correct event format and preserves the first user prompt on title reset. (#368)
- Improved long project-path labels in the project tree. (#354)

### Internal
- Added a frontend CI gate (tsc / eslint / vitest / i18n) on pull requests. (#406)

## [1.14.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Global search now matches tool-result content, not just message text. (#394)
- Recognize the `/branch` custom title as a session-rename source. (#395)
- Detect and parse Gemini CLI `.jsonl` sessions. (#348)
- Show the conversation when navigating from a global-search hit. (#390)
- Project-list scrollbar now reaches the bottom (`min-h-0`). (#101)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **CodeBuddy Code provider** — browse CodeBuddy conversation history alongside the other assistants. (#353)
- **WebUI account login** for `--serve` mode: optional Argon2id account auth + server-side sessions + CSRF, a read-only mode, and base-path support for reverse-proxy hosting. (#384)
- Render advisor tool results instead of the unknown-type fallback. (#380, #386)

### Changed
- Role and content-type message filters now persist across session switches and app restarts. (#363)

### Fixed
- Estimate full height for subagent rows to prevent the React #185 crash when opening large subagent sessions. (#334)
- Map subagent clicks via `meta.json` `toolUseId` for multi-subagent sessions. (#288)
- Include custom Claude directories in the global stats summary. (#362)
- Accept sessions under a symlinked `~/.claude` allowlist root. (#355)
- Configure ibus/fcitx IME env on Linux startup so CJK input works in the search box. (#360)
- Stop a WebUI watcher refresh loop. (#367)
- WSL chat history no longer ignored in project list / global search for Claude-only users. (#347)
- Use the OverlayScrollbars `initialized` event instead of polling. (#351)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **macOS Custom Overlay Title Bar**: Draggable header with `data-tauri-drag-region`; eliminates the legacy macOS title bar so the app uses screen space more consistently. Linux/Windows behavior unchanged. (#337)
- **Session Source Filter**: Reads the top-level `entrypoint` field (`cli`, `claude-vscode`, `claude-desktop`) in Claude Code JSONL records and exposes a filter to separate sessions by where they were created. Cache version bumped to invalidate stale snapshots. (#330)
- **Codex Resume Command**: Right-click "Copy Resume Command" now supports Codex sessions and prefixes the copied command with `cd '<cwd>' && ` so paste-and-run lands in the session's original directory. SessionId is regex-validated before shell interpolation. (#302)

### Changed
- Sidebar resizable panel `maxWidth` raised from 480 → 800 to fit long project names; deep-path slug parsing delegates to the existing filesystem-check decoder. (#329)
- macOS updater falls back to a native OS-level relaunch (`open -n`) when Tauri v2's `relaunch()` throws on macOS; Windows uses PowerShell `Wait-Process` + `Start-Process` (avoids `cmd /C "start"` `%` corruption); Linux uses `setsid`. All paths use parent-PID polling instead of fixed sleeps. (#325, closes #287)

### Fixed
- **Pricing accuracy**:
  - `claude-opus-4-7` was billed at deprecated Opus 4 rates ($15/$75) via `includes()` match-order — added explicit entry at correct rates ($5/$25/$6.25/$0.50). Prevents 3× overcharge. (#335)
  - Added `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5.5` pricing rows and refactored Codex token extraction to return `(input, output, cached)` so `non_cached_input = delta_input − delta_cached` splits the two billing tiers correctly. (#336)
- WSL settings no longer crash when partial settings omit `excludedDistros`; defaults-first spread keeps the toggle working. (#309)
- Session delete failures now surface the backend error in the toast description with the session id, so reporters can diagnose. (#310)
- WebUI mode: `get_session_subagents` registered on the Axum router; closes a Tauri↔Axum parity gap (#294). (#311)
- ForgeCode: stricter virtual-path allowlist, env-guarded `FORGE_CONFIG` tests, archive/rename dialog polish. (#312)
- Antigravity stats correctness: 7 follow-ups across stats aggregation, symlink guards on rpc-cache reads, filesystem-only brain session inclusion, refusing to guess root when marker absent, date-filtered tool usage, rpc-cache fallback for usage records, canonicalised `session_path` validation. (#313, #314, #315, #316, #317, #318, #320)
- Codex session summary picker now skips the auto-injected `<environment_context>` so the displayed summary reflects the actual first user message. (#322)
- Global stats aggregate `token_distribution.reasoning` correctly across providers. (#323)

### Internal
- Tauri 2.10.1 → 2.11.2 (+ plugin patches); JS/Rust version alignment preserved.
- `tauriConfig.test.ts` realigned for the new "empty window[0].title, productName as CFBundleName" design.
- Codex `and_then(|v| v.as_u64())` → `and_then(Value::as_u64)` for Rust 1.95 `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Antigravity Provider**: Sessions loaded through the standard provider pipeline with full project/session views, token stats, analytics, and global search — no separate UI mode (#291)
- **ForgeCode Provider**: SQLite-backed reader for `~/.forge/.forge.db` with multi-provider plumbing for scan, sessions, messages, search, stats, and archive (#295)
- **External Session Launching**: New `--session <uuid-or-prefix>` CLI flag (#261), with single-instance enforcement plus macOS Apple Events for re-invocation (#274), Stage B prefix resolvers and a session picker modal for ambiguous input (#270, #272)
- **Show Sub-agent Messages Toggle**: Header settings dropdown now exposes the existing `excludeSidechain` filter so users can collapse sub-agent clutter without DevTools (#299, addresses #282)
- **Symlink Following at Depth 1**: `scan_projects` follows directory symlinks one level deep with deduplication and tests (#277, #281)

- Preserve bubble timestamps in search results (#273)
- Dedupe token usage across split assistant turn rows (#283, #289)

### Internal
- Align `@tauri-apps/api`, `plugin-dialog`, `plugin-updater` JS packages with their Rust crates (`tauri-action` enforces version match)
- Replace `sort_by` + `Reverse` comparator with idiomatic `sort_by_key` (#275)
